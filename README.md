# Notepad
- Created backend reading, writing and saving logic for the notepad in C#, and frontend using WPF

# 1. Editing the file in the UI
- The spaceholder for user-entered content dynamically updates the character count on the bottom left corner of the window

# 2. Saving and opening a random file and about section
- Here, a file is opened and the content is read in the textbox UI
- An about section which displays the name of the author (i.e. me) and some general information, you might find in orignal notepad
