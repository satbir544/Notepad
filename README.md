# Notepad
- created backend reading, writing and saving logic for the notepad in C#, and frontend using WPF

## 1. Editing the file in the UI
- the spaceholder for user-entered content dynamically updates the character count on the bottom left corner of the window

## 2. Saving and opening a random file and about section
- here, a file is opened and the content is read in the textbox UI
- an about section which displays the name of the author (i.e. me) and some general information, you might find in orignal notepad
